# Windows Tweaks

I created this repository to hold all sorts of registry (`.reg`) files that can modify the Windows experience.  This is a work in progress.

Many of these registry values can be changed in a more user friendly way using the Group Policy Editor, but users with a Home Edition of Windows who cannot access the Group Policy editor can still change the registry to achieve many of the same configurations.

Because directly editing the registry can be intimidating and often dangerous, I've put together these files to automatically apply changes when you open them.

I strongly encourage you to inspect these files before you merge them into your registry, just as a best practice.
